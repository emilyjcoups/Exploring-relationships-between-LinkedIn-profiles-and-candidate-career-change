# Exploring relationships between LinkedIn profiles and candidate career change
 
This project comprises a Jupyter-based computational essay which explores the potential to fit linear models to LinkedIn profile data. 

This was an explorative project which saught to explore whether there were any linear relationships between LinkedIn profile data and career changability factors.

# Methods 

Data exploration - distributions and linear relationships. 
PCA 
OLS regression

# Findings 

No strong or compelling linear relationships were exhibited within the dataset.  

This was a project within my masters in which we were tasked with exploring linear models. In reality, non-linear models could have been more suitable and so this could be a potential useful area for further exploration.
